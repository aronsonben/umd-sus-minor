# UMD Sustainability Minor

This project is being designed to outline the courses available to students 
in the University of Maryland, College Park's [Sustainability Studies Minor.](
http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/undergraduate/academics/minors/sustainability-minor)

At present, students enrolled in the minor must look through [this pdf](
http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/sites/default/files/UpdatedCourseList2.23.2018.pdf)
in order to find and select the required courses needed to fulfill the minor. I am
designing this site to make it easier for students to look for courses and complete
their degree.
